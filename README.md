Softr Website Header with Embedded Content
------------------------------------------
This project provides an interactive web header for a Softr website. The header contains buttons that load different webpage contents seamlessly within an iframe. The data in these pages, presented in the form of tables, is sourced directly from Airtable, allowing for real-time data representation without having to navigate away from the current page.

Features
--------
Airtable Integration: The tables displayed are sourced from Airtable, ensuring the data is always up-to-date and consistent with your Airtable base.
Interactive Header: A user-friendly header with three buttons allowing users to select the content source.
Embedding with iframes: Leveraging iframes to display the content from the Han Company site without leaving the current page.
Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes to provide a consistent user experience across devices.
Stylish UI: Rounded corner buttons and smooth hover transitions paired with a sleek color palette.

Usage
-----
Click on one of the three buttons:

Dept Ticket: Displays the table from 'https://www.han.company/ticket-dept'.
Ticket YÃ¶nlendir: Presents the table from 'https://www.han.company/ticket-bildiri-yonlendir'.
Ticket Gecikme: Loads the table from 'https://www.han.company/ticket-talep-gecikme'.
By default, the "Dept Ticket" content will be loaded when the page is initially accessed.
